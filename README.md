# Dad Jokes

A project used for a workshop on basic application architecture with ZIO.

## Versions
We're utilising ZIO 2.0 in this project, but the same principles apply to ZIO 1.0.
We're using Scala 2.13, but Scala 3.x would work similarly.

## Running the project
The project is built using sbt, so you can run it with `sbt run`.

## Running the tests
The tests are written using ZIO Test, so you can run them with `sbt test`.
